# Parallel_Computing_Assessment
I developed a multithreaded statistics tool which reads in large amounts of data on the weather in Lincolnshire.
Basdic analytics is then held on the data such as mean median and mode.

The challenge came from making the software complete its task in a reasonable amount of time. to do this OpenCl was used to make make used to tun the software with multiple threads.
